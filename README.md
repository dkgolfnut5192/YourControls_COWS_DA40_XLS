 - STARTER PROCESS WILL KEEP CYCLING THE STARTER FROM  START TO BOTH, WHEN THE CAPTAIN IS HOLDING THE STARTER IN A START POSITION. ONCE THE ENGINES START, THE SECOND PILOT MOST DISCONNECT HIS SESSION AND RECONNECT. THIS WILL RELEASE THE STARTER SWITCH FROMCYCLING AND ALLOW IT TO STAY IN BOTH MAGS POSITION.

# FIXES

I recommend that you and your co-pilot first conduct a test flight to check if everything is working properly.
